    <h1>What Do You Want to Know?</h1>
    <h2>Random Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        I usually get <del>excited</del><ins> nervous</ins> when people ask me "Tell me a bit about yourself?"
        It's not even the fact of me not knowing what to say, it's trying to define which
        aspect to talk about. Do I let you know about my life as a single mom, a student, or
        a general spiritual badass? I feel like my life has so many insteresting entangled aspects that are beautifully
        connected to another piece. So in this space I'll talk about me and the anxiousness I have on turning 30.

                So today I realized that I was exactly 100 days away from my 30th birthday. When I tell you this birthday is
                holding some power behind it. The things I expect to come to fruition are unbelievable. The growth in all areas are
                literally sprouting in tangible form. I’m learning how to grow and let things unfold as they should. My problem has been
                that I want to achieve everything and then watch my seeds sprout in the same exact time I plant them. During the last few
                months of being in my 20’s I was forced to reflect on my ability to exert
                patience and learn how to trust myself. It feels like this last 100 days is putting all of that to the test.

            Some of the Goals that I want to complete before I turn 30 seem both outrageous and achievable. Some have been
            in the making, and some have been spare of the moment additions to what I think it would mean to be a total badass.

            Some of my goals include:
            <ul class ="goals">
                <li>-Creating and sustaining a small blog</li>

                <li>-Getting back into the habit of hot yoga and scheduled spa days.</li>

                <li>-Starting a career at Microsoft</li>

                <li>-Stepping on the stage in a NPC bikini competition</li>

                <li>-Not failing out of grad school</li>

                <li>-Being the best mom that I can be.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            As 30 approaches, I also am excited to implement all of the lessons I have learned from the last decade, from
            love, parenting, career, and spirituality. There has been tons of things that I have learned that I am just now
            understanding, but there are a ton of things that I am ready to put into play simply from learning from mistakes.
            I have been at my highest of highs and lowest of lows so far and I think that I am excited for 30 because its welcoming
            balance and blessings.
